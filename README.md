## crypto-socket-auth

Educational implementation of two systems with Java Sockets - symmetric and asymmetric - to simulate usage of cryptography in authentication with mock users in a client-server based system.

The perfomance of each system is then collected in `.csv` files (encryption, decryption, and full authentication times). They are later analyzed with `performance_analysis.py` to measure and compare the speed of each operation in both systems.
